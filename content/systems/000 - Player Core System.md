## 🧭 Overview
Defines the root player entity and acts as the coordination hub for all player-related subsystems such as movement, aiming, input, and combat.

## 🎯 Purpose
Provide a single authoritative entry point for player state and input access while keeping gameplay responsibilities decomposed into specialized systems.

## 🧠 Design Philosophy
- Composition over inheritance

- One responsibility per component

- Player acts as a service locator, not a logic container

- The Player class intentionally contains minimal logic to avoid becoming a god object.

## 📦 Responsibilities
Does:

- Owns and initializes the input action map

- Exposes shared player subsystems

- Enables and disables input lifecycle

Does NOT:

- Handle movement logic

- Handle aiming or shooting logic

- Perform gameplay decisions

## 🧱 Key Components
Classes

- Player

  - Initializes InputSystem_Actions

  - Exposes references to player subsystems

Interfaces / Data

- InputSystem_Actions

  - Centralized input definition generated by Unity Input System

## 🔄 Execution Flow
On `Awake()`, Player instantiates `InputSystem_Actions`

On `Awake()`, Player caches references to player subsystems

On `OnEnable()`, input actions are enabled

On `OnDisable()`, input actions are disabled

## 🔗 Dependencies
Depends On

- Unity Input System

- Player subsystem components (PlayerAim, PlayerMovement)

Used By

- Movement system

- Aim system

- Shooting system

## ⚠ Constraints & Assumptions
- Assumes exactly one Player instance exists

- Assumes all player subsystems live on the same GameObject

## 📈 Scalability & Extensibility
- Additional subsystems can be added without modifying Player logic

- Supports future multiplayer refactor by swapping input ownership

## ✅ Status
In development

## 📝 Notes
The Player class is intentionally thin and should remain so.
