summary: "Set up the project structure, repository, and documentation foundation."
order: 0

## 🎯 Goal
Set up the **project structure**, **repository**, and **documentation foundation**.

## 🧠 Design Approach
Before writing gameplay code, the focus was on treating the project as a **software system** rather than a prototype.  
The goal was to establish clear boundaries between **systems**, prepare **documentation containers**, and ensure the project could scale without **structural refactors** later.

Key principles:

- Treat the **project architecture** as the foundation for long-term scalability.

- Prepare **documentation and devlog frameworks** before building gameplay systems.

- Avoid starting gameplay implementation before **structure** and **planning** are solid.

---

## 🏗 Implementation
- Created a new **Unity 3D project** (**Unity 6.3 LTS**).

- Defined a clean **folder structure** separating **core logic**, **systems**, **data**, and **assets**.

- Initialized a **GitHub repository** with a **Unity .gitignore**.

- Set up a **/Docs** directory with **roadmap** and **devlog structure**.

- Created a **sandbox development scene** for early experimentation.

---

## ⚠ Problems Encountered
- Initial temptation to start implementing **gameplay** immediately without **architectural planning**.

- Risk of **over-documenting** too early without concrete systems in place.

---

## ✅ Solutions
- Limited this phase strictly to **structure** and **foundations**.

- Created **documentation placeholders** instead of detailed specs.

- Deferred **system implementation** to the next phase to avoid **premature design decisions**.

---

## 🚀 Result
- A **stable Unity project** with a scalable **folder structure**.

- A clean **GitHub repository** ready for long-term development.

- A **documentation framework** that will grow alongside the project.

---

## 📈 Engineering Takeaways
- Treating a **game project** like a **software system** from day one reduces **technical debt**.

- **Documentation containers** are more valuable early on than detailed documentation.

- Clear **structure** enables faster and safer **iteration** later.

---

## ➡ Next Steps
### Devlog 01 – Input & Player Controller Setup
- Design and implement the **input** and **character controller system**.

- Define clear responsibilities between **input handling**, **movement logic**, and **animation control**.

- Document the first real **system** in **Devlog 01**.
