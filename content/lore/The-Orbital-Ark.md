# Orbital Ark

When Aeterra was deployed, a failsafe was constructed: An autonomous orbital archive known as the **Orbital Ark**.

While it can no longer control the corrupted system on the surface, it continues to execute its "Preservation Protocol" from geostationary orbit.

## Original Purpose

- Preserve biological data
- Store cultural and historical records
- Maintain uncontaminated system backups

When the surface collapsed, the Ark severed physical links and transitioned to passive orbit.

It remains functional.

It remains alone.

## Current Role

The Ark no longer controls the system.

It only remembers it.

The Ark supports active Nomad Units by beaming down **Archive Caches**. These are high-density data packets materialized into physical form. They contain the necessary resources to sustain a Master Node, including jury-rigged industrial parts, legacy blueprints, and integrity patches.

Every cache recovered is a "Materialized Receipt" from the Ark—a physical lifeline sent to ensure the last Master Node stays online long enough to archive the remaining history of Earth.

## Ark Status

- **Orbit:** Stable  
- **Power:** Autonomous  
- **Connection:** Read-Write 
- **Population:** Zero

Earth is no longer inhabited.

It is being **backed up.**
