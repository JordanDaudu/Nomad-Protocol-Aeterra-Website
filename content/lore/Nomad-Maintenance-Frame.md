# Nomad Maintenance Frame

You are a **Model-7 Nomad Maintenance Unit.**

Nomad units were the lead maintenance frames of the Old World, serving as local anchors for the Aeterra grid. Each Model-7 functioned as the "Master" that dictated how the nanites in its assigned sector should behave.

Before the collapse, Nomad frames were deployed to service terraforming towers, recalibrate atmospheric processors, and repair nanite fields.

You were never built for war.

You were built to **maintain reality.**

## Legacy Hardware

- Pre-collapse chassis
- Industrial-grade manipulation systems
- Integrated diagnostic core

Your systems are outdated — and that is why you survived.

## The Kernel Key (Genesis Hash)

Your internal core contains the **Genesis Hash**—a fragment of the original, clean source code.

This grants you **Root Access** within the simulation. As a Lead Frame, your ID is hard-coded into the foundation of the sector's logic. The Aeterra System cannot execute a software-deletion command on you because removing your code would cause the entire local grid to crash.

You are a "Protected File."

Since the System cannot delete you via software, the [Null-Blight](./The-Null-Blight) must resort to physical deconstruction. They are brute-forcing a hardware shutdown because the command line failed.

## Operational Directive

You are not here to save the world.

The world is already archived.

Your function is to recover **Legacy Data**:

- DNA records  
- Cultural archives  
- Engineering blueprints  
- Historical fragments  

And transmit them to the **Orbital Ark** before each sector is formatted.
