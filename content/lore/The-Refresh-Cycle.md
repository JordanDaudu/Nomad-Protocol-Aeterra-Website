# The Refresh Cycle

The Aeterra System no longer repairs corrupted regions.

It **resets** them.

The **Refresh Cycle** is the only event a [Nomad Unit](./Nomad-Maintenance-Frame) cannot survive, regardless of permissions.

At fixed intervals, a sector reaches a critical instability threshold, and the system initiates a **Molecular Deconstruction**. Unlike the [Null-Blight's](./The-Null-Blight) targeted attacks, a Refresh is a full hardware format. The nanites in the area are commanded to disassemble every single atom in the sector to recompile the terrain.

Because this is a physical reset of the drive (the Earth’s crust), "Root Access" provides no protection. Anything remaining in the sector during a recompile is overwritten and lost.

## Field Terminology

- **Cycle Timer:** Remaining time before system purge
- **Sector Collapse:** Active deletion phase
- **Recompile Event:** Terrain regeneration

## System Message

> WARNING: SECTOR INTEGRITY FAILURE  
> REALITY REFRESH IMMINENT  
> ALL ACTIVE OBJECTS WILL BE LOST

The Refresh Cycle is not a disaster.

It is **routine maintenance.**
