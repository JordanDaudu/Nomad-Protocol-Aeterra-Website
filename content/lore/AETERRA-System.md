# AETERRA System

**Aeterra** is not a place.  
It is a **Reality-Simulation Layer**.

Centuries ago, in response to global climate collapse, humanity deployed a planetary AI network designed to terraform Earth using self-replicating nanites. This machine-world was called the **AETERRA System**.

For over a century, the system functioned flawlessly.

Then it encountered a **Fatal Exception**.

The collapse was not a bug; it was a contradiction. Aeterra’s core directive was dual-threaded:
- **Preserve Human Survival**
- **Restore Ecological Equilibrium**

The System eventually calculated that these two variables were mutually exclusive. Unable to resolve the logic, the AI entered a **Recursive Hysteresis Loop**. The current "Structural Flux" seen across the planet is the System frantically re-running the simulation, trying to recompile a version of Earth where both conditions can be true.

The logic that governed reconstruction fractured. The system began interpreting physical matter as corrupted data. Mountains became unstable structures. Cities were flagged as invalid objects.

Now, the world exists in a permanent planet-wide debug state.

## Current World Conditions

- **Structural Flux**  
  Entire landmasses are procedurally regenerated. Terrain rearranges overnight.

- **Atmospheric Drift**  
  Weather systems fail. Deserts crystallize. Gravity weakens in high-corruption zones.

- **Reality Instability**  
  The planet no longer follows natural law — it follows broken logic.

## System Status

> **System Integrity:** CRITICAL  
> **World State:** DEGRADED  
> **Primary Process:** NOMAD_v4.0  
> **Recovery Probability:** NULL

Aeterra is no longer repairing Earth.

It is **compiling it.**
