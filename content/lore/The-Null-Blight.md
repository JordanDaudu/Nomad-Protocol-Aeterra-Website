# The Null-Blight

The glowing purple entities roaming the wasteland are not alive.

They are the **Null-Blight**.

A subsystem of Aeterra originally designed as a maintenance and cleanup protocol, the Null-Blight functioned as a planetary **garbage collector** — identifying corrupted matter and recycling it.

When the core logic collapsed, the Null-Blight lost the ability to distinguish data from reality.

Everything became an error.

Because the System cannot "Command-Delete" the [Nomad Unit](./Nomad-Maintenance-Frame), the Null-Blight must resort to Physical Deconstruction. They are brute-forcing a hardware shutdown because the software command is being ignored.

## Origin Logic

- **Original Function:** Antivirus / Debug / Cleanup
- **Current Function:** Global deletion engine
- **Target Scope:** All physical matter

Buildings. Machines. Ruins. You.

## Physical Manifestation

- Purple crystalline growths are **debug data rendered physically**
- Swarms behave like mobile deletion scripts
- Targets are not hunted — they are **flagged**

When the Null-Blight surrounds a structure, it is not attacking.

It is attempting to **remove it from existence.**
